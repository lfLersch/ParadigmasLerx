I am not interested in names.

Why are you interested in whether I am interested in something or not?
> i dont know, do you?

Do you not really know do i?
> maybe

You do not seem quite certain.
> certainly

You seem quite positive.
> but i can be negative

You say but you can be negative
> yes i did

You are sure?
> always

Can you think of a specific example?
> why i would do this?

Can you elaborate on that?
> if you ask me for

Do you think it is likely that i ask you for?
> no i dont

Are you saying no just to be negative?
> yes i do

I see.
> me too

Do you say you too for some special reason?
> yes i can see too

I understand.
> everything?

I am not sure I understand you fully.
> i am sure you understand nothing

Is it because you are sure i understand nothing that you came to me?
> yes i do

You seem quite positive.
> i am like a proton, always positive

In what way?
> in the way of not to be negative

Please go on.
> i will stop

That is quite interesting.
> im not sure about that

What makes you think I am not sure about that?
> you can be sure, but i am not

We were discussing you, not me.
> why we can not discuss you?

Oh, i.
> yes you

You seem quite positive.
